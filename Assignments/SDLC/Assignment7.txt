Participants:

    2) Seth – Lead Developer 
    3) Kane - Back-End Developer

    5) Vince – Tester

Stephanie:    Alright team, let's get started! Daily standup. What did everyone work on yesterday?

Seth:    Yesterday, I finished the backend logic for managing close friends lists. Users can now add, remove, and edit their lists. We might have a communication gap, though.

Stephanie:    How so, Seth?

Seth:     There isn't a clear way for users to understand the size limitations for close friends lists. This could lead to frustration if users add too many friends and encounter issues.

Dolph:  That's a valid concern. We should definitely display the maximum list size somewhere in the user interface.

Kane:  Agreed. I can provide the maximum list size information through the API.

Dolph: Great! I can then integrate a clear message displaying the limit next to the "Add Friend" button.

Stephanie:   Dolph this is good option. Proceed for it.

Stephanie:   Vince, any updates from testing so far?

Vince:     Not yet. I'm waiting on the complete list management functionalities before I can start testing adding/removing friends.

Stephanie:     Understood. Once Dolph and Kane finalize the list size indicator, Vince, you can jump in and start testing those functionalities.

Stephanie:  Does anyone have any blockers for today?

Kane:      Actually, I might need some help from Dolph. Integrating the list size information into the API might require a minor adjustment on the front-end to handle displaying it.

Dolph:         No problem, Kane. We can tackle that together this morning.

Stephanie:        Excellent! Let's keep communicating openly if any dependencies arise. See you all tomorrow for another update.
